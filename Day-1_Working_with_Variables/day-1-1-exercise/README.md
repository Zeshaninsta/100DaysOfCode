# Printing to the Console

## Instructions

Write a program in `main.py` that prints the same notes from the previous lesson using what you have learned about the Python `print` function.

**Warning:** The output in your program should match the example output shown below exactly, character for character. This includes spaces and symbols; otherwise, the tests won't pass.

## Example Output

After you have written your code, you should run your program and it should print the following:

```bash
Day 1 - Python Print Function
```
```bash
The function is declared like this:
```
```bash
print('what to print')
```

e.g. When you hit run, this is what should happen:

(1.1.print.webp)

Notes

    Ensure that your output matches the example exactly.
    Double-check for any extra spaces or missing characters.
    Run your program to verify the output before submitting.
